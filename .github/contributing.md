# Contributing to the StackPath WordPress plugin

If you're reading this, it seems likely you're interested in contributing to
the plugin. Thanks a lot! We think that's awesome! Below are some guidelines to
help you get started along with some expectations and tips to make the process
easier.

Bug reports and pull requests (PRs) are welcome.

Before coding any new features or substantial changes, please
[open a feature request](https://github.com/stackpath/stackpath-wordpress/issues/new)
to discuss the proposed changes and benefits provided to the project.

PRs comprised of whitespace fixes, code formatting changes, or other purely
cosmetic changes are unlikely to be merged.

## Bugs

**Do not open a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability;** instead,
email [security@stackpath.com](mailto:security@stackpath.com).

Before opening an issue, ensure the bug hasn't
[already been reported](https://github.com/stackpath/stackpath-wordpress/issues).
If not, [open a new bug report](https://github.com/stackpath/stackpath-wordpress/issues/new)
with details demonstrating the unexpected behavior.

PRs are welcome if you've written a patch for a bug.

## Pull request guidelines

Please ensure the following when submitting a pull request against the project.

* A single commit should implement a single logical change.
* This plugin follows the [PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/) and
  [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) style guides. Use your editor's
  [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) features to help.
* We use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for development dependency
  management and the plugin's class autoloader. Non-development dependencies
  should not be added to the plugin.
* Changes must target at least PHP 5.6 and WordPress 5.3.0.
* There should be no commented out code or unneeded files.
* Documentation should be updated or extended for behavior changes or feature
  additions.
* The commit message should be meaningful. We encourage use of the
  [50/72 rule](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
  in your commit message.

For example, here is a meaningful commit message:
```
Fix an issue purging items that begin with a number
```

To contrast, here is an example of of a poor commit message. Note that it says
literally what changed, but provides no context to readers.
```
Update the Site class
```
